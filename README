OTR support for emacs-jabber; work in progress.

How to use it:

1. Install python-potr.  Run:

   sudo pip install python-potr

   or see https://github.com/python-otr/pure-python-otr .

2. Load jabber-otr.el.

3. M-: (jabber-otr-start)

4. To send a message, use M-x jabber-otr-send.  Currently, the first
   message you send is "lost" if an encrypted session hasn't been
   established yet.  Just send it again.

5. Received messages should be decrypted automatically.
